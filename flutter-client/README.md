# Mentoring app - George & Dobri

**Packages we are using:**

- flutter_svg: [link](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg)

We designed 4 responsive screens first one is a welcome screen.
Then users have two options if the user has an account then press the login button and it just shifts the user to the login screen, 
or if they don't have an account then press signup button its transfers to the signup screen. 

After the Login/Registration screen and successful login the user can see several comic book issues and choose one to read.

All of those screens work perfectly on Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop.
